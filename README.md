## Introduction

This little stylesheet reverts new Bootstrap 3 button styles to the old ones, including `.btn-inverse` again.

They are compatible with the new Bootstrap 3 buttons styles and have the new padding, to fit with other form controls.

Disabled styles, as well as `.btn-lg`, `.btn-sm` and `.btn-xs` are supported.

## How to use

Include bootstrap-buttons.css or bootstrap-buttons.min.css in your Bootstrap 3 project after bootstrap stylesheets to get the old styled buttons.
